## Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. Version control systems are used to save several updated versions of assignments for security purposes.
2. Git is different from other VCS because it basically takes screenshots of code instead of storing data as sets of files.
3. Git commands (add, commit, push, status) are really simple and makes it easy to get started using git.
