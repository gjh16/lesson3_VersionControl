            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control is a system that saves all previous versions of a file to make it easier for the user to access older versions of something if they so desire to. This, in essence means if something was to go wrong like, the file getting lost or you deleting something you need, you have the option to easily go back to an earlier version of that file and work from there. I find all the different types of version control, like local, centralized, and distributed, to be interesting as each has the same fundamental responsibility but house the versions in different places and different ways. Version control rather it be local, centralized, or distributed, is something all web designers should use.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Many people, programmers specifically in this case, work on several projects with all, if not most, being computer based. A driving issue with this is that computers are far from perfect so, if it were to crash, all the stuff you are working on would naturally be deleted. Version Control Systems help ease your mind when things like this occur as you can simply go back to a previous version and start working from that point versus starting all over from scratch. It is interesting how similar yet different this form of file saving seems to that of some cloud computing platforms (like google docs) but VCS saves several updated versions of a file while cloud computing just updates the file on its own periodically. This is relevant to the course because, as web designers, we primarily work on the computer so VCS, give us that added sense of security.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is a bit different from basically every other version control system in the major way that makes these systems version control systems (VCS). Other delta-based VCS work by storing the person’s data as sets of files and all the edits made to those files overtime. Git is different as it is more like a mini file system essentially storing a snapshot of the data every time it’s saved and storing each one systematically. I find it this very important yet general distinction between Git and other more delta-based VCS to be very interesting. I think knowing the difference between Git and other VCS is a must for us as I assume we will be using git throughout the rest of this course.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Getting started with Git Version Control System can be as simple as you make it honestly speaking. You only really need to know how to use a few fundamental terms start controlling versions of your data with Git. First you must initialize a Git repository depending on your computer system but typically by putting “git init” after which you add and commit any files. This is done using the “git add” and “git commit” statements in the terminal. There are a few other commands you’ll need to know to achieve the full potential Git has to offer, however, it is so cool how someone can start version-controlling existing files with these few simple commands. This will be especially important for this assignment as this is how we will get started in Git.</p>

            <h2 class="featurette-heading">How to GIT Tracking
                <span class="text-muted">The vital part of Git</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The entire point of using the Git Version Control System is to keep as many versions of you data as you desire done through systematic tracking of your work. That means it is pretty important to know how to ensure your changes are being recorded as they should be.The “git status” command is also very essential as it shows you the recent changes made to the file, if any. To begin tracking a new file you would use the “git add” command followed by the filename and you should receive a clear message letting you know a change has been made that needs to be committed. The interesting part of tracking to me is the ability to ignore specific files when showing and adding files to b tracked through the command of “.gitignore”. This concept is how we will be able to track all off the changes being made in this course so it is pretty relevant.</p>
